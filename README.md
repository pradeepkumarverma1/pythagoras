# Right Angled Triangle Calculator (Pythagoras)

This JavaScript app helps you calculate the side of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

## Live Demo

You can try out the live app [https://pradeepkumarverma1.github.io/pythagoras/](https://pradeepkumarverma1.github.io/pythagoras/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Right Angled Triangle Calculator, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradeepkumarverma1/pythagoras.git

## Usage

To calculate the length of a side of a right-angled triangle, provide values for two of the three sides:
- If you know the length of the base and height, the app will calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
- If you know the length of the base and hypotenuse, the app will calculate the length of the height.
- If you know the length of the height and hypotenuse, the app will calculate the length of the base.

## Formula

The formula used by the app to calculate the length of the missing side is based on the Pythagorean theorem:
- If you know the base (b) and height (h), the hypotenuse (c) can be calculated as `c = sqrt(b^2 + h^2)`.
- If you know the base (b) and hypotenuse (c), the height (h) can be calculated as `h = sqrt(c^2 - b^2)`.
- If you know the height (h) and hypotenuse (c), the base (b) can be calculated as `b = sqrt(c^2 - h^2)`.
